# Hello!

I'm Andy. I mainly work on data science projects in Python and R. I'm interested in a variety of subjects, including:
- Probability models & statistical analysis
- Machine learning
- Mathematical optimization
- Spatial modeling
- Intuitive data visualization
- Data pipeline architecture

I enjoy using these subjects in combination to solve real-world applications, particularly in physics, medicine, and transportation logistics.
